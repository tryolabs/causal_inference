# Causal Inference
Measure the impact of an intervention in a time series, using different sources as references.

## Starting
Before starting, select python 3.7.6, and then:
 - Configure poetry to keep venvs locally (VSCode will detect it out of the box):
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

 - Install dependencies (this will also create the venv):
```
poetry install
```

 - Enjoy. e.g: run the VSCode style notebook: `test_notebook.py`
